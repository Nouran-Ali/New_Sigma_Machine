    overview: `
High-Speed Production with Multiple Tools Ready at the Same Time

The Multi-Process CNC Router is designed for high-efficiency workshops and factories that require continuous production without delays caused by manual tool changes.
Each spindle holds a different tool (bit), enabling the machine to switch operations automatically by shifting to the correct spindle—without any ATC system.
This makes it ideal for high-volume woodworking, furniture manufacturing, panel cutting, engraving, and decorative CNC projects.
